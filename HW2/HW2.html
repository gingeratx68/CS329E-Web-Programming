	<li> I am most proud of my accomplishment of designing a bra for the Breast Cancer Research Center of Austin annual Art Bra event in 2022. My bra I designed was sold at a live auction runway for $2500 and all proceeds go towards helping those with breast cancer and those affected by breast cancer in the Austin area. You can find pictures from my design process for this bra and Art Bra event <a href="http://mortalvision.company/design-gallery/mortalvisionprojects/">here</a>! </li>
	<li>I am working towards completing a Certification in Computing Sciences while getting my degree at UT. I have worked with Python and I am currently learning Web Programming.
